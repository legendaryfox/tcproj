A CBO creates an opportunity
An opportunity always has a questionnaire attached to it
-the questionnaire always has the 'core questions'
--when a user fills out the questionnaire, the core question answers are autofilled from the user's preferences
-it may have additional questions attached to it
=> we know that a questionnaire will have at least X questions
-when a user fills out the q

PART I: FINISH OPPORTUNITIES
-implement ability for CBOs to create opportunities
-implement more information into opportunities
--date(s), general description, etc

PART II: CREATE QUESTIONNAIRES
-questionnaires belong to CBOs; opportunities can reference questionnaires
--strongly advise against editing a published questionnaire
-opportunity has at most only one questionnaire; a questionnaire can be used for multiple opportunities
-a questionnaire response (qresponse) - flat text file??

PART III: Users applying via questionnaires

Model: Community
-anyone (CBO, student) can join
-has its own location, and its own set of CBOs/users
--good for caching later on
--although, maybe this is better added to Seeds. Iuno.

NEED to generate two :through join relations for belonging Users to communities and CBOs to communities...ugh.


Add a default distance to scope the community's "jurisdiction"

-"Post to Community" - user or cbo can write a short message, post to a community; a post has_many communities and a community has_many posts

-to deal with admin viewing, give them proxy users and proxy cbos
