Model: Community
-anyone (CBO, student) can join
-has its own location, and its own set of CBOs/users
--good for caching later on
--although, maybe this is better added to Seeds. Iuno.

NEED to generate two :through join relations for belonging Users to communities and CBOs to communities...ugh.


Add a default distance to scope the community's "jurisdiction"

-"Post to Community" - user or cbo can write a short message, post to a community; a post has_many communities and a community has_many posts

-to deal with admin viewing, give them proxy users and proxy cbos
